# cv_autoencoding_ligand_binding
Collective Variable Discovery by Deep Encoder-Decoder Model

Here, in this repository, time-evolution of three trajectories have been shown
with visualization of the snap-shots in vmd along with time-evolution on 
free energy surface. 

The lig-binding-ae-model.py python file will take the ligand-com-to-C-alpha distances as input vector 
and after model training and prediction, it will return us the hidden-projected
"encoded data". This "encoded data" will be needed for all our future work.

we need to pre-installed keras and tensorflow to run our code.
